2. **ðŸŒº Flowering Tree** - Scene.js-based tree with complex multi-level branches and flowers
3. **ðŸŒ³ Fractal Tree** - Canvas-based recursive fractal patterns with mathematical precision
4. **ðŸ˜Š Character Tree** - Character-based tree with facial expressions and bee animations
5. **ðŸŒ¿ Myau Original** - Original CodePen adaptation with GSAP animations
